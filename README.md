## Tip calculator using DOM💪🏾

Aisha wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever she goes eating in a restaurant. In her country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Using your DOM knowledge when user enters his bill inside the textbox and clicks on the button
   - Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value.
   - Display a the following sentence using dom inside the P tag with the class name of result Example: _'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'_

Good Luck 😀
